            <h3>Fire Drill  - The Office US</h3>
            <button class = accordion>Synopsis</button>
            <div class="panel">
In this comedic scene from the US version of “The Office,” a fire drill, orchestrated by Dwight, spirals into chaos. Employees panic, fire alarms stun the office, people flee desks, and the situation becomes humorously absurd as normal workplace norms break down.
                </div>
            <button class=accordion>Cultural Notes</button>
            <div class="panel">
- American workplace comedies often use fire drills or emergency scenarios as a setting for comedic exaggeration — showing how normal routines collapse under stress.  <br>
- The humor depends on everyday office culture (cubicles, memos, the annoyances of corporate life) which may feel familiar to learners from English-speaking settings.  <br>
- Learning from this scene helps with understanding idiomatic reactions (panic, “fire,” running out) and casual conversational tone, useful for everyday English.<br>
